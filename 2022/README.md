# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022 - Language Roulette Challenge 🎄

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2022** challenge repository! 🎅 This is my personal journey through 25 days of coding puzzles, but with a twist: each puzzle will be solved in a randomly selected programming language from a diverse pool of 25 languages.

## 🚀 Challenge Overview

- **Advent of Code 2022** consists of 25 coding challenges, released daily from **December 1st** to **December 25th**.
- Each challenge will be solved using a programming language selected randomly from the following pool. Once a language is chosen, it is removed from the pool and cannot be used again.

### Primary Languages:
- Objective-C
- Scala
- Haskell
- Go
- Rust
- C++
- C#
- JavaScript
- F#
- PHP
- Zig
- Shell/Bash
- Kotlin
- Groovy
- Dart
- Fortran
- Ada
- Cobol
- Perl
- R
- Swift
- Lua
- Ruby
- Visual Basic
- Elixir


## 🛠️ Cheating Languages

If I'm not feeling up for the challenge with the randomly chosen language for the day, I have the option to "cheat" and use a language from the **Cheating Languages** list instead, like the primary languages, once a cheating language is used, it is removed from the pool.


### Cheating Languages:
- OCaml
- C
- Python
- Java
- MATLAB

## 🎯 Rules

1. **One puzzle per day** from the Advent of Code 2022.
2. The language for each day's challenge will be chosen by spinning a wheel from the list of **Primary Languages**.
3. If I don't want to use the selected language for a particular day, I can use a **Cheating Language** instead, but only **5 times** total.
4. Once a language is used (either primary or cheating), it is removed from the pool for the rest of the challenge.
5. Code will be pushed daily to this repository.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
/
|-- day1/
|   |-- solution.<language>
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- day2/
|   |-- solution.<language>
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- day3/
|   |-- solution.<language>
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- dayN/
|   |-- solution.<language>
|   |-- README.md
|
|-- README.md
```

- Each day's solution will reside in its own directory (`day1/`, `day2/`, etc.).
- Each directory will contain:
  - The solution file (`solution.<language>`) based on the language selected for that day.
  - A `README.md` file for how to run the code.

I will update this table daily to track my progress, including which languages have been used and whether I used a cheating language.

## 🎯 How to Run

For each day's solution, instructions will be provided in the corresponding `README.md` for how to run the code. This will depend on the language selected.


## ⭐ Advent of Code

If you're not familiar with **Advent of Code**, it’s a series of programming puzzles that are released each day in December leading up to Christmas. You can check it out and join in on the fun at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com).
