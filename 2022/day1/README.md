# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2022 - Day 1 ðŸŽ„

This repository contains the code for **Day 1**, written in **Dart** using the **Flutter** framework.

The code that solves the problem is in `flutter_app/lib/main.dart`

## ðŸ“¥ How to Install Flutter and Dart

To run this project, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. Dart is included with Flutter, so you only need to install Flutter.

1. Visit the official Flutter installation guide:  
   [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

2. Follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

3. Once Flutter is installed, you can verify it by running:

   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```
    or

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```



## ðŸš€ How to Run the App


1. Navigate to the `flutter_app` repository:

   ```bash
   cd flutter_app
   ```

2. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

This will build and run the Flutter application. You can select your desired device (emulator or connected device) for the app to run on.
