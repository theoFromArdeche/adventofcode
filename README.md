## ðŸ¤– About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual coding challenge that takes place every December. Each day, a new problem is released, challenging programmers of all levels to solve algorithmic puzzles. It's a great way to practice problem-solving skills, explore different languages, and have fun with a global community of coders.
